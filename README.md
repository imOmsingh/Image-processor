The only problem is how to display such large images in the front end of the project.
Solution: Using cloudmersive API or other to convert the larger RAW image to jpeg images and store them in place of the large file so data of the file can be easily fetched fromt the mongoDb and image displayed will a a low quality jpeg files. 
Problem: Cloudmersive free API allows 3mb image upload which is very small for any raw image and oaid version can not be bought rn.
